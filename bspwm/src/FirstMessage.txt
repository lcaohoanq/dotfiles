Hello, welcome to BSPWM

Maybe it's your first time using a window manager or maybe not, here are some tips so you don't feel so lost.
  · You can always visit my Wiki https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/wiki
  
    - (F1) For a list of all keyboard shortcuts (If it doesn't open, please visit https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/wiki/Installing-EWW)
    - (Super + Enter) Opens the terminal
    - (Super + q) To close windows/apps.
    - (Super + Space bar) Opens the apps menu
    - (Alt + Space bar) Open the menu to change the theme
    - (Super + arrows) Move between workspaces (there are 6)

Remember that I tried to make the environment in a MINIMALIST way but giving you what you need to make it comfortable and efficient for your daily work. However, some of the features you can find are:

    - A menu to manage your connections which you can access by clicking on the   icon in the different bars.
    
    - If your computer has Bluetooth, the icon will appear in the different bars and open a Bluetooth manager. But you should always have a specialized app like Blueman.
    
    - Scratchpad (super + alt + o)
    
    - Clipboard Manager (super + alt + c)
    
    - Terminal Selector (super + alt + t) You can choose between 2 terminals, "Alacritty" and "Kitty". By default, it is Alacritty.
    
    - Wallpaper selector (super + alt + w) The first time you run it in each theme, it may take 3 to 5 seconds for the menu to appear because the images are being cached the first time.
    
    - Screenshot menu (super + alt + s)
    
    - And other features such as hiding the bars (super + alt + h) and (super + alt + u) to show them again.

Please check the menu of all keyboard shortcuts by pressing "F1" or directly by looking at the file ~/.config/bspwm/sxhkdrc from this file you can create your own keyboard shortcuts or modify the existing ones.

If you have a question or a problem or if you find a bug, you can always create a post at https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/issues

Using a WM at first can be difficult and intimidating, but once you get used to it, you never go back to a DE.
